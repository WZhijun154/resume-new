Responsible for developing and optimizing planning and control algorithms for autonomous driving.
Utilized C++ for embedded systems and Python for algorithm development.

- Deployed VectorNet and DenseTNT for trajectory prediction on Journey 5 and Journey 6 AI chips.
- Developed a simulator for the Target Selection Module. This simulator uses real-world data from the CAN bus to simulate target selection logic, primarily for debugging and performance optimization.
- Optimized Target Selection logic based on obstacle posture, enabling the ego vehicle to preemptively select a neighboring lane obstacle as the main target 1300ms before it attempts to cut into the ego lane.
